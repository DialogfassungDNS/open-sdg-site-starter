<h3>The UN Sustainable Development Goals</h3>

The [Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/) is a global United Nations action plan for people, the planet and prosperity, which has been adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015. The Agenda 2030 of the United Nations is a roadmap to "transform the world for the better" by the year 2030 in terms of sustainable transformation of society, economy and environment. The Agenda 2030 contains 17 global goals divided into 169 targets with over 240 indicators.

<h3>Reviewing the goal achievement</h3>

The UN Statistical Commission was charged together with the national statistical offices to develop global indicators for the targets. The mandated "Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators" ([IAEG-SDGs](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/)) presented and continuously developed a set of indicators for this purpose. This IAEG-SDGs consists of statistical offices of some UN member states, including the Federal Statistical Office for Germany.

<h3>National Reporting about sustainable development</h3>

In July 2019 the Federal Statistical Office has released a national reporting platform concerning the indicators of the UN goals for sustainability â€“ the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). On that platform there are presented statistical data and metadata regarding Germany and the global sustainable development in an edited and interactive way. The DNS-part of the platform was released February 2020 and includes data and metadata regarding the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS).
